"""Recovery (#recovery): how recovered you are, what your training has asked of you, where you are sore, and how
your body has answered training.

- How recovered: the Today page's own verdict (HRV, resting heart rate and last night's sleep against your normal;
  two of three worse = below your normal), so both pages always agree.
- Training load: each workout's effort on Apple's 1-10 scale (your rating in the Fitness or Workout app, else the
  watch's estimate; workouts.csv `effort`) times its minutes, summed per day. This is the session-RPE method from
  sport science (Foster et al. 2001), and the same idea as Apple Fitness's own Training Load. The last 7 days
  (today so far included) are set against the weekly average of the 28 days before them: above 1.3 times reads as
  more than you are used to, below 0.8 as less (the Exercise page's minutes-only load uses the same lines).
  Workout minutes without an effort score are left out and counted; with under half of the minutes rated the load
  says it is unsure. A day with no workout, inside the range the workout record covers, is a load of 0.
  No device measures how tired the nervous system is. The load is what the training asked of you, as you (or the
  watch) judged it; the next morning's HRV and resting heart rate are the autonomic nervous system's answer.
- How the body answered (response): over the last RESPONSE_DAYS days, the next morning after hard days (load above
  the median of your training days) against every other known day (easier days and rest days): HRV in percent and
  resting heart rate in beats against your normal that morning, and, where you checked in, the most sore region's
  level. Difference of means with a 95% interval, at least stats.MIN_GROUP_DAYS days a side, Benjamini-Hochberg
  across the three; only what survives is a difference. An association, not a cause.
- After training (after_training): for each training day, one score the next morning, 0-10, from four parts put
  side by side and averaged (the one total score this app shows, and every part is shown with it):
  - how you feel that morning, your own answer on the check-in: 2, 5 or 8;
  - HRV the morning after against the morning before the training;
  - resting heart rate the day after against your normal;
  - the night after: how long you slept against your normal, and how much of the time in bed you were asleep
    against your normal (the two averaged).
  Each body part is 5 plus 2.5 for every width of your normal it lies away (the width of the middle half of your
  previous 28 days, at least SPREAD_FLOOR), better direction up, kept between 0 and 10; so 5 is a usual morning
  and 7.5 is one band width better. For HRV the normal is that of its morning-to-morning changes, since HRV moves a
  lot from one morning to the next and a change is what the part measures. A morning needs at least two parts, one of them from the body, for a score.
  6.5 and above reads as recovered well, under 3.5 as not recovered.
- Soreness: the morning check-ins in soreness.csv (1 a little, 2 clearly sore, 3 very sore, per region of the body
  figure). The figure shows the latest check-in; the last SORE_DAYS days show each region's levels. A day without a
  check-in is unknown, never "not sore".
