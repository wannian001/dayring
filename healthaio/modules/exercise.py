"""Exercise: this week against the weekly goal, the last 7 days against your normal, training load against
recovery, twelve weeks by kind, and how your body tends to answer each kind the next day.

Rules
- Active minutes of a day = the Activity ring's exercise minutes (body_daily.exercise_min), which count any brisk
  movement; on a day without them, the minutes of logged workouts. Missing stays missing.
- The weekly goal is [plan.exercise] when set, otherwise the WHO guideline for adults: 150 minutes of moderate
  activity a week and muscle-strengthening on 2 or more days. The page says which one it uses.
- A week runs Monday to Sunday. What is left is shared over the days left, today included.
- Kind of a workout, from its type: strength (strength, weights, core, functional), cardio (running, cycling,
  swimming, rowing, HIIT, ...), walking (walking, hiking), other (yoga, pilates, sports, anything else).
- Last 7 days (ending yesterday, today is not over) against your normal: active minutes and workouts as 7-day totals
  against the middle half of the 7-day totals ending on each of the 28 days before (a total needs at least 5 days
  with data); steps and active energy as daily averages, like the Drain page.
- Load: workout minutes of the last 7 days over the weekly average of the 28 days before. Above 1.3 = clearly more
  than you are used to, under 0.8 = clearly less. A rule of thumb from sport science, not a diagnosis. Read together
  with the Today page's recovery: more load on a recovery below normal says rest.
- The next day after each kind: HRV against the median of your previous 28 days (in percent) and resting heart rate
  against its median (in bpm), the median over the last 120 days of that kind. A description, not a test: the Today
  page's list is where differences are tested.
