"""Follow-up: did yesterday's advice happen, and when a piece of advice keeps not happening, another way to do it.

Saying what to do each morning is half of being proactive; the other half is noticing whether it happened and, when
the same reminder keeps failing, changing the approach instead of repeating it. This page does both, from the data
alone: there is nothing to tick.

Rules
- A past day's advice is rebuilt from the data as it stood that morning, with the same rules as the Today page
  (modules/actions.py). The sleep, food and screen rules read only last night and the days before, so a rebuild gives
  what the page said then. Training advice reads the day's own workouts (what is left of the week), so a rebuild
  would already know the answer: it is listed, not checked.
- Each piece of advice is checked against what the data shows afterwards. No record is "no record", never a miss.
  - asleep_by: asleep that night no more than 15 minutes after the time given.
  - phone_away: no more than 15 minutes of entertainment & social in the hour before falling asleep that night.
  - late_meal: the last meal that day at least plan.food.last_meal_gap_h before falling asleep (a logged day).
  - protein: that day's protein at least 90% of the target (a logged day).
  - kcal: that day's energy at or under the plan's maximum (a logged day).
  - fun_cap: that day's entertainment & social at or under the cap (a whole screen day).
- The last 14 days: how often each piece of advice was given and on how many of the days with a record it was kept.
  Counts, never streaks or scores.
- Another way: advice not kept on 3 or more of the last 5 times it was given (with a record) gets three concrete
  alternatives with your own numbers instead of the same reminder: a smaller step (halfway between what you have
  been doing and the target, then three days in a row before moving on), letting the phone or the room do the
  remembering, and an if-then plan ("if it is 00:30, I put the phone on the charger in the living room"). If-then
  plans are among the better-tested ways to close the gap between meaning to and doing (Gollwitzer & Sheeran 2006, a
  meta-analysis of 94 studies, d = 0.65). These are habits, not medical advice.
