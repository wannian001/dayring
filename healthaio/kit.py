"""The Health AIO design kit: the files that carry Health AIO's look, and a manifest built from them as they are on disk.

    python3 -m healthaio kit json          # print the manifest (also served at /api/kit, and api/kit.json on the static site)
    python3 -m healthaio kit export DIR    # copy the kit into another app: DIR/css/..., DIR/js/..., DIR/kit.json
    python3 -m healthaio kit check DIR     # per file: up to date, outdated, modified locally or missing
    python3 -m healthaio kit lock          # after a new KIT_VERSION: record its file hashes in healthaio/kit.lock.json

Design flows one way, from healthaio to the apps that copy the kit. A copy is never edited in place: an app keeps
its own components in its own files, and a local improvement to a kit file is ported back to Health AIO, given a
new KIT_VERSION and exported again. See docs/DESIGN_KIT.md.
