"""The data contract: every table Health AIO reads, defined in one place.

All tables are UTF-8 CSV files with a header row, kept in the data directory
named in ``healthaio.toml``. Importers write them; modules only read them.
``docs/DATA_FORMAT.md`` is generated from this file (``python -m healthaio schema --markdown``).

Conventions
- ``date``: local calendar day, ``YYYY-MM-DD``.
- ``datetime``: local wall-clock time without offset, ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`` (seconds optional).
  The timezone is the one in ``healthaio.toml``. One exception: ``sleep_start`` / ``sleep_end`` from
  Apple Health are in the zone you slept in, so a night abroad reads as you lived it.
- Minutes are real minutes: on the day clocks go forward the skipped hour is not counted, and a
  record that runs through the repeated hour when they go back counts it twice (23- and 25-hour days).
- Empty cell = unknown. Unknown is never read as zero.
- A sleep belongs to the day you woke up.
